    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "In the first attempt I have tried with moderate multiples of 2. In such manner, I've put words to be divided in batches of 64 seqs with seq_length of 10 words. Most senteces have 5-6 words, 10 words are more than enough to guess the whole context of a sentence and generate contextual data. vocab and output size coincide with the dict int we have previously prepared. 64 sequence in a batch offers a a good feedback about the process, allowing to quickly abort it if result is not as expected. Then, I have selected an embedding dim of 100 just to test and 128 as hidden dim (I remember some lesson about encoding-decoding where multiples of 2 were set as preferred to reduce pipeline loss). Finally I set three layers and 10 epochs as are good options to evaluate most neural networks. The learning rate was 0.01. I normally start with 0.01 as it offers a good trade-off between time invested and results as well as allow evaluating the gradient performance. In that case I got 5.12 but the loss was not linearly descending meaning that learning rate should be smaller or complexer the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I decreased the learning rate to 0.005 what improved results to 4.14 but still the learning rate was not able to properly approximate the local minima. Hence, I aborted training and decreased the lr even more, down to 0.001.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 10 epochs the loss is: 3.49. Thus, aiming to achieve better results and evaluate other parameters, the embedding dim have been also tuned in a 5th test. This embedding dim of 350  basis on the lessons, wherein values in the range 200 to 500 are considered adequate for most cases. There we can see that the model converges in a similar fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "A final test has been carried (6th) increasing the lr to 0.002 and hidden_dim to 512 but reducing the layers to 2 and the embedding to 300 which has delivered loss 3.04. Going into test with this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "------- -----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, at the beggining I saw the model quickly converging to values near 0. This unusual overfitting told me that there were some error in the code. Furthermore, when I tested the models the results consisted of repeated sentences without dialogues. This made me go back to the code, after checking the last functions I identified a problem with the get_batch function wherein I was uncorrectly partioning data despite tests and \"visual results\" seemed correct."
